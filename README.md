Motivation for Investigating Juvenile Crime Risk Factors

Crime poses a deep cost to society, both directly in terms of damage inflicted but also indirectly in terms of use of public resources to manage it. In investigating the causes of crime, there is much focus on risk factors in young people. The dominant discourse observed in the juvenile justice system is the Risk Factors Prevention Paradigm (RFPP), which offers a readily intelligible framework of statistical correlations between factors and criminally relevant outcomes. While it has great appeal for its claim to highlight causal conditions (and therefore facilitate the construction of preventative or remedial programmes), it has also been criticized for being misleading and omitting the impact of essential psychological and motivational processes as well as relevant variables such as values, personal agency and human rights (Oâ€™Mahony, 2009). The ongoing debate surrounding risk factors in juvenile crime provides the motivation for this study in which I examine the explanatory power of variables describing inhabitant composition across Greater London boroughs, and criminal offences both in total, and by young offenders (aged 14-17 years old).

The following data sets for the financial year 2015 were collected and merged.
+ Total number of crimes reported by the Metropolitan police.
+ Crime reports from the Youth Justice Board (YJB). 
+ Borough surveys from the London Data Store. 

Data Pre-Processing Considerations
The Metropolitan police report does not include the City of London, so I remove this from consideration in youth crime. Also, young offender crimes in Kingston and Richmond are aggregated in the YJB report, so the same value is shown for each borough when presented visually. The borough surveys include a wide range of detail about the inhabitants in each borough, including socio-economic factors, education, health and satisfaction data. In the UK, young offenders are criminals whose ages range from 14 to 17.  

Research Questions:
I analyse the data with visual and computational methods in order to answer the following questions: 
1.	Which boroughs have the highest concentrations of crimes committed by young offenders and in crimes in total?
2.	Is there a geographical relationship between youth crime and crimes in total?
3.	What factors appear to be associated with crimes by young offenders?

Research Tasks:
To satisfy the questions, I perform the following:
1. Visually describe how the crime rate varies across Greater London Boroughs, highlighting the proportion committed by young offenders. 
2. Select and justify variables that appear to explain variation in crime rates by young offenders.
3. Create a model to test the explanatory power of the variables that appear to be associated with crime rates
